# Linear-Regression

Implementation of linear regression using the set of x and y from the data collection “World happiness scores and ranking corresponding to the GDP factors” from kaggle.com. 

## Implement a function linearregression.  
It takes in a set of sample data and produce the corresponding linear regression coefficients. It is capable of multiple linear regression, so the input data will be a matrix (or 2-D array) where the rest m columns are the independent variables at each sample point, and the last column is the dependent variable. The function should also calculate and return the correlation coefficient. 

## Main Program
Write a main that validates your chosen function by generating data and using it to show that your regression code work properly. Applies your function to a noisy data set.

The plot above show the linear regression of the data set with correlation coefficient equals to 0.62

## Problem discussion 
Why/how can linear regression be applied to data that follows an exponential trend? A high-level explanation is sufficient.
